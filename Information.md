This handy tool can be used to get teleport locations for your GUI with ease!
Simply save your locations to the table and write the table to a file with a click of a button!
The output consists of a table with your location names and CFrames.
Output can be found at `.../workspace/Saved Locations [game name].lua`
GUI is draggable and can also be toggled using RightShift.
